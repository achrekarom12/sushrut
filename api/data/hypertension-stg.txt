Since the provided cardiology document focuses on ACS and congenital defects, it doesn't detail a primary management protocol for Hypertension. I’ll provide a Standard Treatment Guideline (STG) for **Hypertension** tailored to the **Indian population**, drawing from the **Indian Hypertension Guidelines (IHS)** and the **Indian Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI)**.

## 1. Classification of Blood Pressure

In India, hypertension is often diagnosed late, so regular screening is vital for anyone over 18.

| Category | Systolic (mmHg) | Diastolic (mmHg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Normal** |  |  |
| **Pre-Hypertension** |  |  |
| **Stage 1 Hypertension** |  |  |
| **Stage 2 Hypertension** |  |  |

## 2. Diagnosis and Assessment

* **Measurement:** Diagnosis should be based on the average of at least two readings taken on two separate occasions.
* **White-Coat Effect:** Common in India; if clinic readings are high but the patient seems low-risk, Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) is recommended.
* **Initial Tests:**
* Urine analysis (for protein/albumin).
* Fasting blood glucose (to check for co-existing diabetes).
* Serum creatinine and electrolytes.
* ECG to check for Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH).

## 3. Lifestyle Modifications (The "Indian Context")

Lifestyle is the first line of defense, especially for pre-hypertension.

* **Salt Restriction:** Aim for  per day. In India, this specifically means reducing "hidden" salts in pickles, papads, chutneys, and salted snacks (namkeen).
* **DASH Diet (Indianized):** High intake of fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy. Increase potassium intake through coconut water or bananas (unless the patient has kidney issues).
* **Weight Reduction:** Maintain a BMI  and a waist circumference  for men and  for women.
* **Physical Activity:** 30–60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (like brisk walking) at least 5 days a week.
* **Limit Alcohol & Tobacco:** Complete cessation of tobacco is mandatory to reduce cardiovascular risk.

## 4. Pharmacological Management

For most Indians, the "A-B-C-D" protocol is used, starting with a single drug for Stage 1 and often dual therapy for Stage 2.

### 4.1 Choice of Initial Drug

1. **ACE Inhibitors (A):** (e.g., Enalapril, Ramipril) or **ARBs** (e.g., Telmisartan, Losartan). Note: The uploaded cardiology document confirms ACE inhibitors are indicated for patients with proven CAD.


2. **Calcium Channel Blockers (C):** (e.g., Amlodipine). Highly effective in the Indian population.
3. **Diuretics (D):** (e.g., Chlorthalidone, Indapamide). Preferred as an add-on or in the elderly.
4. 
**Beta-blockers (B):** Usually not first-line for "plain" hypertension unless the patient has a co-existing condition like post-MI or heart failure.



### 4.2 Combination Therapy

If BP is , starting with a **Single Pill Combination (SPC)**—typically an ARB + CCB—is now the preferred Indian standard to improve patient compliance.

## 5. Treatment Targets

The goal is to reduce long-term cardiovascular events.

* **General Target:** .
* 
**High-Risk Target:**  for patients with Diabetes, Chronic Kidney Disease, or established Coronary Artery Disease.



> **A Note on "The Silent Killer":** Many patients stop medication once they "feel fine." Education must emphasize that hypertension is a chronic condition requiring lifelong management, even when asymptomatic.

Would you like me to create a **medication adherence checklist** or a **home-monitoring log template** for you?
