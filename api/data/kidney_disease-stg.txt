The following Standard Treatment Guideline (STG) for **Thyroid Disorders** is tailored for the Indian population, where Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) and Autoimmune Thyroiditis (Hashimoto's) are the leading causes of thyroid dysfunction.

## 1. Hypothyroidism

Hypothyroidism is the most common thyroid disorder in India, frequently affecting women of reproductive age.

### 1.1 Diagnosis

* **Primary Screen:** Serum **TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)** is the most sensitive first-line test.
* **Confirmatory Tests:** If TSH is high, test for **Free T4**.
* **Etiology:** Anti-TPO (Thyroid Peroxidase) antibodies help diagnose Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
* **Subclinical Hypothyroidism:** Defined as an elevated TSH with a normal Free T4. Treatment is generally started if TSH  or if the patient is pregnant.

### 1.2 Management

* **First-Line Therapy:** **Levothyroxine** (T4).
* **Administration:** Must be taken on an empty stomach, at least 30–60 minutes before breakfast, with water only.
* **Dosage:** Typically  body weight/day. In the elderly or those with cardiac issues, start with a lower dose ().
* **Monitoring:** Re-check TSH 6–8 weeks after starting or changing the dose.

## 2. Hyperthyroidism

Characterized by excessive thyroid hormone production, often due to Graves' Disease.

### 2.1 Diagnosis

* **Profile:** Low TSH with elevated Free T4 and/or Free T3.
* **Graves' Disease:** Suspected if the patient has a goiter (enlarged neck) or bulging eyes (ophthalmopathy).
* **Imaging:** Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU) scan helps differentiate Graves' from thyroiditis.

### 2.2 Management

* **Anti-Thyroid Drugs (ATDs):** **Methimazole** (preferred) or **Propylthiouracil (PTU)** (preferred in the first trimester of pregnancy).
* **Symptom Control:** Beta-blockers (e.g., Propranolol) are used to manage rapid heart rate and tremors.
* **Definitive Therapy:** Radioactive Iodine (RAI) ablation or total thyroidectomy if ATDs fail or are not tolerated.

## 3. Thyroid and Pregnancy

Thyroid health is critical for fetal brain development. In India, universal screening for TSH is recommended as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.

| Trimester | TSH Target Range |
| --- | --- |
| **First Trimester** |  |
| **Second Trimester** |  |
| **Third Trimester** |  |

## 4. Goiter and Thyroid Nodules

A goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland, common in India's "Goiter Belt" (the Himalayan and sub-Himalayan regions).

* **Assessment:** Physical palpation followed by an **Ultrasound of the Neck**.
* **Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC):** Performed if a nodule is found to rule out thyroid cancer.
* **Iodine Status:** Ensure the use of **Iodized Salt**, which has been the cornerstone of India's National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme.

## 5. Lifestyle and Nutrition

* **Iodine:** Use iodized salt. However, avoid excessive iodine (like kelp supplements) which can trigger autoimmune issues.
* **Goitrogens:** For those with iodine deficiency, limit raw intake of cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli), though cooking usually neutralizes these compounds.
* **Iron and Calcium:** Do not take iron or calcium supplements within 4 hours of your thyroid medication, as they interfere with absorption.
